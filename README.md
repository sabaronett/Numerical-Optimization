# Numerical-Optimization
This is a course material for numerical optimization to be taught in summer 2020 (June-August, 10 weeks) through webex. I have not finalized the schedule yet. It is completely open to everyone. If you are interested, please feel free to contact qiang.zhu@unlv.edu between 2020/06-2020/08.

## Textbooks
This course is intended to cover
- Various optmization methods used in scientific computing
- Julia programming

The course will mostly follow the book of [Algorithms for Optimization by Mykel J. Kochenderfer and Tim A. Wheeler](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-optimization).
Here is an intersting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofWy5kaZU3g) by one of the authors talking about how they wrote the book in a recent Julia confernece.

For some details on the optimization algorithms, we will refer to [Numerical Optimization by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-40065-5)

## Format
Though this is a virtual class, we plan to make it as interactive as possible. Typically, each class is composed of three units. 

- Codes review (1 or 2 volunteers to review the previous homework assignments)
- Lecture (Math details for each algorithm)
- Coding session (code accomplishment of the algos in each lecture)

All codings will be done through jupyter notebook.

Each class will take about 90 minutes.
